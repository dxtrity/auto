# auto
Auto is a collection of data that is used across multiple projects. It's composed of common data and elements that are reused or change often but need to be kept independent from the applications.

## Projects
An example of projects using this dataset is **dxPack Installer**. A compact and simple modpack installer for minecraft modpacks. The pack uses the dataset as a database to fetch the mods and mod URLs to download and install onto the user's computer. It's very easily adaptable and configurable.
